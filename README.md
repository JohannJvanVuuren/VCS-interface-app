### 1. Introduction

NB GITLAB REPOS AND COMMITS
NB Because of different API structures the two VCS were treated separately

### 2. Installation

The App in its development phase is very easy to install. It is just a question of installing all of the required dependencies. So change first into the `backend` subfolder and then into the `frontend` folder before running the command `yarn install in the terminal inside the two subfolders respectively.  

### 3. Usage

To follow.

### 4. Credits and Versioning

This application was designed and written by Johann Jansen van Vuuren and the initial version is v1.0.0. Release of this version will be included in this section as soon as the project has been completed.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. It has to be used in both the backend and frontend folders of the project to start both ends of the project.  

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
